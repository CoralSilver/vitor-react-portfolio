				    <p class="about-text">A passionate photographer, I began my professional career in Rio de Janeiro, creating fashion editorials for a local, avant-garde fashion brand. Working with black and white film, I developed and printed the images in my own darkroom, which I built in my apartment. Now working in digital photography, primarily as a studio photographer, I enjoy experimenting with lighting effects, composition, and post-production techniques.</p>
